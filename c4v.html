          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p> <a class= "social" href="https://c4v.com/" target="blank">C4 Ventures</a> is a venture capital fund based in London: one of their 3 investment themes is "future of commerce". Assessing investment opportunities allowed me to developed a deep understanding of marketplace dynamics. My goals were:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Quickly assess the potential of 20+ deals per week.</li>
              <li> Conduct in-depth due diligence on promising companies (market, product, business model, competition, traction...).</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class= "text-projects-2">
  <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> I ran the due diligence process for 2 companies: 
            <ol>
              <li> A <strong>marketplace for handyman services</strong>. Main questions: Competitive advantage over the many competitors and growth potential in their segment. </li>
              <li> An <strong>on-demand fitness streaming platform</strong>. Main questions: Ability to create stickiness with the audience and scale recording operations.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p> We did not end up investing in these companies, so I cannot speak to any result beyond the trust I developed with the founders and the impact my analysis had on our decision. However, I learned a lot, including: 
            <ol>
              <li> It's very hard to launch a marketplace, even harder to monetize.</li>
              <li> Customer experience (through stickiness) and technology (through automation) are crucial to achieve growth and profitability.</li>
              <li>One metric can make or break the model, so we must be data-driven: acquisition costs, supply/demand balance, commission and conversion rate, churn, etc.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
