          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p> Fujitsu France is a subsidiary of the japanese IT giant. The General Manager joined 5 years ago with a mandate to transform the business from low-margin hardware and IT outsourcing to high-margin services (cloud migration, AI...). As his right-hand, I supported him and the steering committee in strategic projects. My main goals in the  agile transformation project were:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Formalize, help cascade strategic objectives (1y / 5y) and set-up KPIs to track progress. </li>
              <li> Launch and oversee agile practices diffusion through the company in 6 months.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class= "text-projects-2">
  <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> My work evolved with the project, with main achievements being : 
            <ol>
              <li>Consolidated objectives and pushbacks from the 13 members of the steering commitee to generate buy-in.
              </li>
              <li>Oversaw tender process for our partner consultancy firm.</li>
              <li>Communicated with employees, recruited 5 cross-functional pilot teams as well as an internal scrum master team.
              </li>
              <li>Held scrum-master team retrospectives, acted as scrum master for a pilot team, and shared progress with the steering committee.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p> I left after 3 months (pilot phase). Today, results are as follows: 
            <ol>
              <li> Out of 5 teams, 1 was very successful with the new practices, 3 are still fiding their marks and 1 has stopped. A few others have been launched.
              </li>
              <li> The scrum master team has grown from 4 to 6.</li>
              <li> The steering committee works with 10 prioritized yearly objectives and an associated KPI dashboard to be reviewed each month.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
