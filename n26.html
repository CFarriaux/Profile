          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p> I worked on a cross-functional initiative to enable N26 to scale by keeping the experience stellar while controlling customer support costs. I was split between a newly-formed "customer experience" product team and an operations team, which allowed me to really get a 360 view on CX, and collaborate with almost every stakeholder in the company. My goals were:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> <strong>Product:</strong> support the PM in discovery to understand how to better anticipate users' issues.</li>
              <li> <strong>Operations:</strong> Prioritize the issues to resolve through business impact, propose and test solutions.</li>
            <ol>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class= "text-projects-2">
  <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> In product, I led an entire <strong>iteration of user research</strong> with our designer, to understand how N26 customers resolve questions or problems with the app. From drafting hypotheses to overseeing prototype design, running interviews, summarizing and sharing results. This led to additions such as the "report problem" button on transactions. I also oversaw a <strong>migration to salesforce lightning </strong>to increase productivity, which gave me exposure to the project management side of product.</p>

          <p> In operations, I created business cases for our <strong>top 30 customer issues </strong>based on business impact (cost to support, impact on churn, etc.). I created processes to add them to product teams' roadmaps, easing arbitration between new features and bug fixing, and <strong>dashboards to follow resolution progress</strong>, which helped share visibility between product, customer support, and management. Lastly I <strong>proposed solutions</strong>, aligning with product to ensure feasibility. For example, I mapped the entire process for disputing card transactions, the most complex customer support operation, identifying where optimizations were possible. </p>
