          <h3>Mission</h3>
	  			<p> I worked for two years at Training Orchestra part-time, in New York then Paris. As the first employee in New-York, I helped launched the business with the CEO. Training Orchestra had a great product - an ERP to manage classroom training logistics and budgets - which was completely new to the american market focused on E-learning. My goals were:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Adapt our product positioning and evangelize the US market through content</li>
              <li> Generate leads through business development and partner enablement</li>
            <ol>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class= "text-projects-2">
  <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> I took our content arsenal from 0 to 15+ pieces to power our inbound strategy, including <a class= "social" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shifting-mindsets-learning-technologies-beyond-lms-st%25C3%25A9phane-pineau/" target="blank">articles</a> and <a class= "social" href="https://trainingorchestra.com/resources/5-minute-guide-to-a-trms/" target="blank">infographics</a> which greatly increased our social following. I also collaborated with an external agency to launch our <a class= "social" href="https://trainingorchestra.com/" target="blank">new website</a>, which we completely reworked to appeal to an american audience. This entailed working on design and high-level messaging as well as value propositions and relevant features for each customer segment.</p>

          <p> I attended 6 HRTech tradeshows across the US, qualifying leads with the sales team and running <a class= "social" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7zO_6oaQX4" target="blank">sessions.</a> I also created and delivered multiple <a class= "social" href="hthttps://trainingorchestra.com/resources/optimizing-learning-and-development-for-the-financial-services-industry-on-demand-webinar/" target="blank">webinars</a> to target specific segments and partners.   </p>
