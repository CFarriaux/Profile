          <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p> As part of the X-HEC Entrepreneurs master, I am spending 3 months at UC Berkeley in the  <a class= "social" href="https://learn2launch.berkeley.edu/home" target="blank">Learn2Launch</a> program. I work with two other students on a project to help fashion brands monetize and control their second-hand market. Our main goals for the semester are:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Find product-market fit with one fashion brand segment. </li>
              <li> Create an MVP for a second-hand fashion pricing algorithm.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class= "text-projects-2">
  <h3>Results</h3>
          <p> The core of our work is around customer discovery. <strong>Can we find a model that aligns interests between 1) brands, end-consumers and (potentially) second-hand marketplaces? 2) sustainability and profits?</strong>
          </p>
          <p> 
          We know that:
            <ol>
              <li> Second-hand fashion is growing 20x faster than traditional fashion and the bulk of profits go to second-hand marketplaces such as <a class= "social" href="https://www.vestiairecollective.com/" target="blank">Vestiaire Collective</a>.</li>
              <li> Some brands have started investing, eager to recruit new customers and generate revenue streams, but most are worried about brand image and profitability.</li>
              <li> Startups taking a brand-centric positioning are flourishing, either with white-label models (<a class= "social" href="https://www.yerdlerecommerce.com" target="blank">Yerdle</a>) or posting to second-hand marketplaces (<a class= "social" href="https://www.reflaunt.com/" target="blank">Reflaunt</a>).
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p> We have interviewed every role from heads of sustainability, e-commerce, digital and innovation, operations within brands, as well as competitors and end-consumers. Our interviews started free-form to understand the problem and we are introducing protyping to test our solution-specific hypotheses.
          </p>
          <p> The technical part of our project is building a pricing algorithm to predict the optimal price of a luxury good on the second-hand market. Our hypothesis is that instant price transparency will incentivize sellers and brands to participate in second-hand as profitability is ensured.
